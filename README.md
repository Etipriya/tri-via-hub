# Initial Idea

A user should be able to visit the site and on the homepage they will be presented with all Studio Ghibli movies. Once they click on a movie it will take you to the page for that movie where you can view the trailer and read reviews (and age rating?. The user can also leave a review/rating and add the movie to their list if they are logged in.

If the user isn't logged in, the navbar on the homepage should have links for Home, Quizzes, Login, and Sign Up. Once they click on Quizzes, it will redirect them to log in.

If the user is logged in, the navbar will also have a Dashboard to view their personal profile, and instead of Sign Up/Log in, it will have log out.

The Dashboard will have a list of movies that the user has selected (favourites, queue, watch history) and they will be able see their reviews for the movies. They should also be able to see their friends list and an option to add or delete friends. The user will also be able to see the quizzes that they have created (including how many people have taken their quiz and the average score and rating) and the quizzes that they have completed with their score. Once they click on their quiz they can manage the comments that have been posted and have the option to delete the quiz.

The quiz page should show some recommended/featured quizzes and on the right side it will have an option for the user to create a quiz.

The create a quiz page should allow the title, description, tags, and questions. If the user needs inspiration they can choose an option that shows characters or locations fetched from the API.

When a user is looking for a quiz they can either search for one that they are interested in or use the filter to filter by tags applied to a quiz.

Once the user has completed the quiz, they will see their score, average user score, an option to leave a review, and an option with a link to the quiz to share with a friend.
