# Initial Idea

A user should be able to visit the site and on the homepage they will be presented with some quiz categories (with images). Once they click on a category it will take you to the page for that category where you can view the quizzes for that category.

If the user isn't logged in, the navbar on the homepage should have links for Home, Quizzes, Login, and Sign Up. Once they click on Quizzes, it will redirect them to log in.

If the user is logged in, the navbar will also have a Dashboard to view their personal profile, and instead of Sign Up/Log in, it will have log out.

The Dashboard will have a list of quizzes that the user has completed or added to their list (favourites, and to do) and they will be able see their scores for the quizzes. The user will also be able to see the quizzes that they have created (including how many people have taken their quiz and the average score and rating) and the quizzes that they have completed with their score. Once they click on their quiz they can manage the comments that have been posted and have the option to delete the quiz.

The quiz page should show some recommended/featured quizzes, a search bar, an option to filter by tag or category, and on the right side it will have an option for the user to create a quiz.

The create a quiz page should allow the title, description, category, tags, and questions. If the user needs inspiration they can randomly generate some questions using the API.

Once the user has completed the quiz, they will see their score, average user score, an option to leave a comment, rating, and an option with a link to the quiz to share with a friend.
